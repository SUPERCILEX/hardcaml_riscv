#slide(title: [Execute])[
  #uncover("2-")[
  - Previous stages must pass their predicted next program counter along
    - Must be correct (as in the next instruction in the pipeline must be the predicted one)
    - It can be anything (security concerns aside)
    - Take advantage of low branch-to-instruction ratio to minimize storage cost by placing predicted pc in auxiliary SRAM instead of ROB
  ]
  - Verify prediction
]

#slide(title: [Decode])[
  #grid(rows: (auto, 1fr))[
    - Jump: address is hardcoded, always redirect
    - Jump relative: if a return, can make near perfect guess using return address stack
    - Branch: address is hardcoded, choose taken if points backwards, not taken if points forwards

  - #link("https://www.sifive.com/blog/all-aboard-part-3-linker-relaxation-in-riscv-toolchain")[Linker relaxation] performs compile-time macro-op fusion
  - Virtual functions require `jalr`
  - Dynamic languages can optimize out if able to prove function will never be overridden (for example final class)
  - Rust does not enable relaxation #link("https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/361")[by default] #emoji.face.sad
]

#slide(title: [Return address stack (RAS)])[
  Perform updates in decode or fetch stage.

  On a call instruction, push to the stack.
  On a return, pop.

  What happens when the stack is full?
  Don't care!
  Prediction will be nonsense, but retirement will catch it.
]

#slide(title: [RAS â€” mispredictions #emoji.face.think])[
  - Cheap solution: keep track of RAS pointer, restore correct pointer on misprediction
    - Fails to handle pop #sym.arrow push sequence
    - Fixes tearing (e.g. we mispredicted a pop)
  - Full solution: replicate RAS and perform a direct FF #sym.arrow FF copy on misprediction
    - Typical RAS size for 32 64-bit addresses: 256 bytes, 2048 bits
]

#slide(title: [Fetch])[
  Can we do anything? Have access to the program counter...
]

#slide(title: [Branch target buffer (BTB)])[
  - Remember past jumps and branches
    - Only store taken branches
  - Repeat the last retirement action
  - Only update at retirement
    - Decode stage will do its thing
    - Don't know the real direction until retirement
    - Too large for FF copy
    - Indirection might work, but probably not worth it
]

#slide(title: [BTB contents])[
  - Memory size limited to single-cycle access latency
    - Need fetch prediction every cycle
  - Store target program counter
    - Maybe store relative offset to use fewer bits?
  - Store (partial) tag to avoid total misprediction failures
  - Is it a return instruction? Peek return address stack
  - Is it a jump? Always redirect
  - Is it a branch? Consult dynamic predictor

#slide(title: [Frontend design considerations])[
  Goal: keep backend *full* with *useful* instructions.

  Low power: use accuracy metric to stall when uncertain (e.g. `jalr`).

  The #link("https://inria.hal.science/hal-01799442/document")[paper] includes an analysis of prior art (including perceptron predictors).

#slide(title: [BAyesian (partially) TAgged GEometric predictor (BATAGE)])[
  - Base prediction handled by bimodal predictor
  - Array of bimodals each indexed by geometrically increasing history length
  - Allocate entry on misprediction (at retirement)
]

#slide(title: [Global history (GH)])[
  For every branch (and jump), store its outcome in a global history.
  Example: `1110111100000001000101011010`

  Banks are indexed by the program counter and this history.
]

#slide(title: [Consequences])[
  - Brilliant way to handle short loops
  - Correlates branch sequences
    - Example: `i % 2` in a loop
]

#slide(title: [GH â€” mispredictions])[
  - Need history to be accurate
    - Update in fetch, decode, and retirement stages
  - Unlike RAS, no pop
    - Keep head pointer in each stage, restore pointer from older stage on misprediction
    - Cascading chain of priorities (from retirement to fetch)
  - Typically \~1000 bits
]

#slide(title: [BATAGE bimodals])[
  - Store `num_takens` and `num_not_takens` as $N$ bit fields instead of direction/hysteresis
  - Tracks confidence: let $k = abs(#[`num_takens`] - #[`num_not_takens`])$
    - $k = 0$ #sym.arrow min confidence
    - $k = 2^N - 1$ #sym.arrow max confidence
  - Favor oldest high confidence predictions

  - Think of the children
    - Paper is great, but the code is hard to read
    - Use long variable names

    - Minimize global state
  - `for` loops with dependencies are a PitA to translate into hardware
  - Verification is challenging

#slide(title: [Random thoughts cont.])[
